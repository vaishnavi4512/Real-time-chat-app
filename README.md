This project is a lightweight, responsive, and modern Real-Time Chat Application built with React.js for the frontend and WebSocket for real-time two-way communication. It uses the wss://echo.websocket.events WebSocket server for demo purposes, making it suitable for learning and understanding how WebSockets work with React without requiring any backend setup.

The app mimics a simple chat interface like WhatsApp or Messenger, where users can type a message, send it, and instantly receive an echoed response from the WebSocket server. It is designed to be minimal yet functional and is ideal for frontend developers who want to add a real-time feature to their portfolio or learn the basics of WebSocket integration in React.
